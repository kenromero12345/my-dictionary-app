1. What is the URL to your GitHub-Pages site?
https://kenromero12345.github.io/my-dictionary-app/

2. What API did you use and why?
I used Free Dictionary API. 
https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>

I used it because I was choosing APIs that have data that have lists and APIs that doesn't have a limit of responses because it is only the free plan of the API.

3. What are some other applications for your API other than searching? Name a few and describe how an app using it for that purpose might work.
Since it is a dictionary app, it allows to get the definition of the word.

4. Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be responsive &amp; mobile-friendly.
I just tried to use my phone to see if the app works fine and it does. I didn't really have any thing I changed for it. As long as <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /> is on the index.html, I think it will be fine.

5. How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or colorblindness?
Possibly find a way to get the app to speak the definitions of the word that is searched. Maybe there exist an API that will do it.

6. If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the experience, what
would they be and how would you go about implementing them?
I would like to add more information about the word such as the word's phonetics, synonyms, and etcetera.
