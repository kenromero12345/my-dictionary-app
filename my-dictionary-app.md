1. What is the URL to your GitHub-Pages site?
https://kenromero12345.github.io/my-dictionary-app/

2. What API did you use and why?
I used Free Dictionary API. 
https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>

I used it because when I do not want to use a key that has a limit of responses because it is only the free plan. I do not want to pay for better plans.

3. What are some other applications for your API other than searching? Name a few and describe
how an app using it for that purpose might work.

4. Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be responsive &amp; mobile-
friendly.

5. How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or
colorblindness?

6. If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the experience, what
would they be and how would you go about implementing them?
